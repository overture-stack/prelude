# Phase One

## Overview

**This guide is for** those in phase one of Prelude's deployment process. The primary goal is to set up Stage, Arranger, and Elasticsearch to access and explore your tabular data through data exploration pages. 

**By the end of this guide you will be able to:**

1. Generate and configure Elasticsearch mappings
2. Generate and configure Arranger UI configurations
3. Transform and load your CSV data into Elasticsearch and onto your data table
4. Create multiple data exploration pages for independent datasets
5. Theme your Stage UI to match your organization's branding

**You will need:**

## Background Information

Phase One focuses on configuring how your data will be displayed in the front-end portal. During this phase, you'll determine the number of data tables needed and their configurations. This is also the ideal time to apply custom theming to your portal. The goal is to establish the look and feel of the user experience before proceeding to more complex back-end data management configurations.

### Architecture Overview

![Phase 1 Architecture Diagram](/docs/images/phase1.png 'Phase 1 Architecture Diagram')

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Composer** | A command-line tool for processing CSV files into Elasticsearch. It handles data transformation and loading. |
| **[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/elasticsearch-intro.html)** | A powerful search and analytics engine that enables flexible and efficient querying of massive datasets. |
| **[Arranger](https://docs.overture.bio/docs/core-software/arranger/overview)** | A search API and UI component generation service that creates configurable data exploration interfaces. |
| **[Stage](https://docs.overture.bio/docs/core-software/stage/overview/)** | A React-based user interface framework designed for easy deployment of customizable data portals. |
