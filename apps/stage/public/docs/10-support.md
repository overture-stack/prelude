# Support

## Support

We take pride in our software and are passionate about helping others use them. If you are looking for help or collaboration, here is how you can get in touch.

## GitHub Discussions

Our primary platform for community support, feature requests, and general discussions is GitHub Discussions. This allows us to keep all conversations in one place and make them easily searchable for future reference.

## Contacting by email

If you have a collaboration or business enquiry you can reach us by email at **contact@overture.bio**

### Getting Help

- [Create a Support Discussion](https://github.com/overture-stack/docs/discussions/categories/support)
  - If you need assistance with Overture, please create a new discussion in our support category.
  - Before creating a new discussion, please search existing discussions to see if your question has already been answered.

### Feature Requests

We love hearing your ideas for improving Overture! Before making a feature request, please check our current roadmap to see if your idea is already planned:

- [Overture feature roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/overture-stack/projects/11/views/1)

If your idea isn't on the roadmap, feel free to create a new discussion in our Ideas category:

- [Submit a Feature Request](https://github.com/overture-stack/docs/discussions/categories/ideas)

## GitHub Issues

We use GitHub Issues primarily for tracking confirmed bugs and ticketing development tasks.

### Reporting Bugs

If you come across a potential bug or issue, please post it as a GitHub support discussion first:

- [**Report a Potential Bug**](https://github.com/overture-stack/docs/discussions/categories/support)

This allows us to confirm the issue and gather more information if needed. If we determine that further development is required, we will create a GitHub Issue from your discussion post.

## Staying Informed

- [Release Announcements](https://github.com/overture-stack/docs/discussions/categories/announcements)
